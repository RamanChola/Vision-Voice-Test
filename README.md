## <div align="center">Vision</div>

Why are human eyes so much more capable? Basically, it is because they have more components which collect information.Our eyes arenâ€™t just performing a task, they are the portal through which our brain can tell us about our world, learn new things, and make wonderful memories.

The eyes are the physical portal through which data from your environment is collected and sent to your brain for processing. The brain plays its part by converting the light that went into your eyes into usable information â€“ how far away, how bright, what color.Humans are built to collect information with their eyes and even reduced vision quality creates a negative effect. 
All of which are reasons why vision is such an important thing to take care of.

Your Eyes Can Reveal A Lot About Your General Health. This includes:
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Lupus
- Psoriasis
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Thyroid diseases
